# Using `ggplot2`: graphs in layers
--------------

R has very simple and valid set of commands for making plots, however more recently a plotting system named **ggplot** have been developed to improve graphical representations. Have a look at the [ggplot2 website]](http://ggplot2.org/) for more details  and instruction for download and install. **ggplot2** was developed by Hadley Wickham (*ggplot2, Use R, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-98141_1, Â© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009*)  according to the `grammar of graphics` (Wilkinson, 2005):

>*ggplot2 is designed to work in a layered fashion, starting with a layer showing the raw data then adding layers of annotation
and statistical summaries. [..]*


Using ggplot2 has many advantages that will be clear through the practical part of this tutorial.

What Is The Grammar Of Graphics?
--------------------------------

The basic idea: independently specify plot building blocks and combine them to create just about any kind of graphical display you want. Building blocks of a graph include:

-   data
-   aesthetic mapping
-   geometric object
-   statistical transformations
-   scales
-   coordinate system
-   position adjustments
-   faceting

The structure of a `ggplot`
---------------------------

The `ggplot()` function is used to initialize the basic graph structure, then we add to it. The structure of a ggplot looks like this:

``` r
  ggplot(data = <default data set>,
         aes(x = <default x axis variable>,
             y = <default y axis variable>,
             ... <other default aesthetic mappings>),
         ... <other plot defaults>) +

         geom_<geom type>(aes(size = <size variable for this geom>,
                        ... <other aesthetic mappings>),
                    data = <data for this point geom>,
                    stat = <statistic string or function>,
                    position = <position string or function>,
                    color = <"fixed color specification">,
                    <other arguments, possibly passed to the _stat_ function) +

    scale_<aesthetic>_<type>(name = <"scale label">,
                       breaks = <where to put tick marks>,
                       labels = <labels for tick marks>,
                       ... <other options for the scale>) +

    theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray"),
          ... <other theme elements>)
```

Don't be afraid, you will understand this by the end of the tutorial! The basic idea is that you specify different parts of the plot, and add them together using the `+` operator.

Example Data: `iris`
------------------------------

We will use a data set that comes with the basic version of R named `iris`. Check in the [data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) page info bout rock. To visualize it type the data set name on your R prompt and have a look at the table:

``` r
  iris
  head(iris[1:4, ])  # *first four rows, all columns*
```
Also to have an idea of the data.frame structure type:

``` r
str(iris)
'data.frame':	150 obs. of  5 variables:
$ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
$ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
$ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...
$ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...
$ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels "setosa","versicolor",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

```
As you see the last column is the species. To find out how many different species there are:

```
levels(iris$Species)
[1] "setosa"     "versicolor" "virginica"
```

`ggplot2` VS Base Graphics
--------------------------

Compared to base graphics, `ggplot2`

-   is more verbose for simple / canned graphics
-   is less verbose for complex / custom graphics
-   does not have methods (data should always be in a `data.frame`)
-   uses a different system for adding plot elements

`ggplot2` VS Base for simple graphs
-----------------------------------

Base graphics histogram example:

``` r
  hist(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

`ggplot2` histogram example:

``` r
  library(ggplot2)
  ggplot(iris, aes(x =Sepal.Length )) +
    geom_histogram()
```

Base wins!

`ggplot2` Base graphics VS `ggplot` for more complex graphs:
------------------------------------------------------------

Base colored scatter plot example:

``` r
  plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data=subset(iris, Species=="setosa"))
  points(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data=subset(iris, Species=="versicolor"), col="red")
  legend(3.8, 4.7,
         c("setosa", "versicolor"), title="Species",
         col=c("black", "red"),
         pch=c(1, 1))
```

`ggplot2` colored scatter plot example:

``` r
  ggplot(subset(iris, Species %in% c("setosa", "versicolor")),
         aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species))+
    geom_point()
```

`ggplot2` wins!

If we don't have to subset it can be even easier:

``` r
  ggplot(iris,
         aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species))+
    geom_point()
```

Geometric Objects And Aesthetics
================================

Aesthetic Mapping
-----------------

In ggplot land *aesthetic* means "something you can see". Examples include:

-   position (i.e., on the x and y axes)
-   color ("outside" color)
-   fill ("inside" color)
-   shape (of points)
-   linetype
-   size

Each type of geom accepts only a subset of all aesthetics--refer to the geom help pages to see what mappings each geom accepts. Aesthetic mappings are set with the `aes()` function.

Geometic Objects (`geom`)
-------------------------

Geometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:

-   points (`geom_point`, for scatter plots, dot plots, etc)
-   lines (`geom_line`, for time series, trend lines, etc)
-   boxplot (`geom_boxplot`, for, well, boxplots!)

A plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the `+` operator

You can get a list of available geometric objects using the code below:

``` r
  help.search("geom_", package = "ggplot2")
```

or simply type `geom_<tab>` in any good R IDE (such as Rstudio or ESS) to see a list of functions starting with `geom_`.

Points (Scatterplot)
--------------------

Now that we know about geometric objects and aesthetic mapping, we can make a ggplot. `geom_point` requires mappings for x and y, all others are optional.

``` r
  ggplot(iris,
         aes(y = Petal.Length , x = Sepal.Length )) +
    geom_point()
```
Now try also

```
  ggplot(iris,
         aes(y = Petal.Length , x = Sepal.Length )) +
    geom_point( aes(color=Species) )

```

We can also assign the plot to an object

```
myplot <- ggplot(iris, aes(y = Petal.Length , x = Sepal.Length ))

```


Text (Label Points)
-------------------

Each `geom` accepts a particualar set of mappings--for example `geom_text()` accepts a `labels` mapping.

```
  myplot  +
    geom_text(aes(label=Species), size = 3)
```

Also try this:

```
myplot  + geom_text(aes(label=Species, color=Species), size = 3)

```

Aesthetic Mapping VS Assignment
-------------------------------

Note that variables are mapped to aesthetics with the `aes()` function, while fixed aesthetics are set outside the `aes()` call. This sometimes leads to confusion, as in this example:

```
  myplot +
    geom_point(aes(size = 2),# incorrect! 2 is not a variable
               color="red") # this is fine -- all points red
```

Mapping Variables To Other Aesthetics
-------------------------------------

Other aesthetics are mapped in the same way as x and y in the previous example.

```
 myplot +
    geom_point(aes(color=Species, shape = Species))
```
