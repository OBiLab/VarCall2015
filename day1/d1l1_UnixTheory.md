## What is the command line interface (or Terminal)?
![](../Projects/img/f3_shell.png)


## Open a command-line terminal on your computer

You can type a command and then type [Return]:
```
~$ date
sab 23 apr 2016, 08.56.51, CEST
```

Or you can launch a program typing its name at the terminal prompt and then type [Return]:

```
~$ python
Python 2.7.9 (default, Apr  2 2015, 15:33:21)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>


```

## The Terminal can be customized

- Change default color
- Change text size and font
- Increase/decrease transparency
- Resize it
- Have multiple windows open side by side
- Change the command prompt (most commonly a ```$```  or ```%``` sign)
- Make the cursor blinking

## The Unix shell

- The shell is a command-line interpreter that lets you interact with Unix
- The shell takes what you type and decides what to do with it
- The shell is actually a scripting language somewhat like Python
 -It is always possible to change shell (either temporarily or permanently)

## The command-line interface (terminal) allows you:

- to send typed instructions to  the computer (i.e., run programs, move/view files, etc.)
- to see the output that results from  those instructions

>Every time you type any Unix command and **press enter**, the computer will attempt to follow your instructions and then, when finished, return you to the **command prompt**

## What is the filesystem tree?

Type the Unix command ```ls``` at the command prompt: what happens?

```
~$ ls

```
